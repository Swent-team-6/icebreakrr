# Icebreakrr
Welcome to our project: Icebreakrr, an application designed to facilitate first "in real life" contacts between people. We are a team of seven students carrying out this project as part of the  "CS-311: The Software Enterprise" EPFL course. We are not accepting external collaborators at the moment.

## The app
Icebreakrr uses the location of the phone to allow people in close proximity to discover each other and meet in real life.
Each user creates a profile based on a photo, a catchphrase, a brief description and a few relevant tags, then shares it with all nearby users. By sharing profiles with nearby users, people can identify common interests, break the ice, and initiate conversations more naturally.

## Features (subject to change): 

- Account Creation & Multi-Device Sync: Create an account for seamless access across multiple devices.
- Nearby User Discovery: Find profiles of people in vicinity using real-time location data.
- Profile Filtering: Sort and filter profiles based on tags, interests, or other parameters to find relevant matches.
- Meet-up Requests: Ask for a meet-up via the app’s meeting request feature.
- Offline Mode: Profiles can be saved manually or automatically (last seen) so they can be accessed even when offline
- Privacy Controls:
  - Toggle location services on or off to control when the user is discoverable.
  - Set custom discoverability filters (e.g., limit who can see the user's profile based on age, interests, or other factors).
