# Icebreakrr
Welcome to our project: Icebreakrr, an application designed to facilitate first "in real life" contacts between people. We are a team of seven students carrying out this project as part of the  "CS-311: The Software Enterprise" EPFL course. We are not accepting external collaborators at the moment.

## The app
Icebreakrr uses the location of the phone to allow people in close proximity to discover each other and meet in real life.
Each user creates a profile based on a photo, a catchphrase, a brief description and a few relevant tags, then shares it with all nearby users. By sharing profiles with nearby users, people can identify common interests, break the ice, and initiate conversations more naturally.
