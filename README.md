# Icebreakrr
Welcome to our project: Icebreakrr, an application designed to facilitate first "In Real Life" contacts between people. We are a team of 7 students carrying out this project as part of an EPFL course. We are not accepting external collaborators at the moment.

## The app
Icebreakrr uses the location of the phone to allow people in close proximity to discover each other and meet IRL.
Each user creates a profile based on a photo, a catchphrase, a brief description and a few relevant tags, then shares it with all nearby users. By sharing profiles with nearby users, people can identify common interests, break the ice, and initiate conversations more naturally.

Features (subject to change)

- Account Creation & Multi-Device Sync: Create an account for seamless access across multiple devices.
- Nearby User Discovery: Find profiles of people in your vicinity using real-time location data.
- Profile Filtering: Sort and filter profiles based on tags, interests, or other parameters to find relevant matches.
- Meet-up Requests: Ask for a meet-up via the app’s meeting request feature.
- Offline Mode: Access and save profiles of people you have encountered, even when you’re offline.
- Privacy Controls:
  - Toggle location services on or off to control when you're discoverable.
  - Set custom discoverability filters (e.g., limit who can see your profile based on age, interests, or other factors).
