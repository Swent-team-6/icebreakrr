# Milestone M2: Team Feedback

This milestone M2 provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on two major themes:
First, whether you have adopted good software engineering practices and are making progress toward delivering value to your users.
Is your design and implementation of high quality, easy to maintain, and well tested?
Second, we look at how well you are functioning as a team, how you organize yourselves, and how well you have refined your collaborative development.
An important component is also how much you have progressed, as a team, since the previous milestone.
You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document.
As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

We looked at several aspects, grouped as follows:

 - Design
   - [Features](#design-features)
   - [Design Documentation](#design-documentation)
 - [Implementation and Delivery](#implementation-and-delivery)
 - Scrum
   - [Backlogs Maintenance](#scrum-backlogs-maintenance)
   - [Documentation and Ceremonies](#scrum-documentation-and-ceremonies)
   - [Continuous Delivery of Value](#scrum-continuous-delivery-of-value)

## Design: Features

We interacted with your app from a user perspective, assessing each implemented feature and flagging any issues encountered. Our evaluation focused mainly on essential features implemented during Sprints 3, 4, and 5; any additional features planned for future Sprints were not considered in this assessment unless they induced buggy behavior in the current APK.
We examined the completeness of each feature in the current version of the app, and how well it aligns with user needs and the overall project goals.


Your app is good, it meets the requirements in terms of mandatory functionality. Your implementation of the location-based is great. You now need to make a deeper impact by showing to users how they can use this, by working on the process of discovery of people.

Your features are good, without friction or bug, except maybe the messaging which can still be difficult to grasp for the user. Overall you are on the right track!

Regarding the value of your features, you have really worked on the essential for now. This is exactly what you have to do. First have an MVP, then go into more complex details, which we feel this is currently what you have. You could maybe try to go beyond for the next steps and start testing the value with users to integrate their feedbacks in your development process.


For this part, you received 7.2 points out of a maximum of 8.0.

## Design: Documentation

We reviewed your Figma (including wireframes and mockups) and the evolution of your overall design architecture in the three Sprints.
We assessed how you leveraged Figma to reason about the UX, ensure a good UX, and facilitate fast UI development.
We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure.


Your Figma contains the essential elements. It would be good to make it more detailed, planning ahead features. It would also be beneficial to be more precise in the actions the user needs to undertake to do some tasks. It will help you make the UI coherent. For example, you can start thinking about the improvement of the messaging functionality and how to reply directly in the Figma before implementing the feature. Then, asking feedback from users or friends, you could make sure that what you are going to implement is understandable.

Your architecture diagram is good. Some links are a bit hard to understand, and you could maybe make the layout clearer. But otherwise your architecture seems fine for now!


For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.0.

## Implementation and Delivery

We evaluated several aspects of your app's implementation, including code quality, testing, CI practices, and the functionality and quality of the APK.
We assessed whether your code is well modularized, readable, and maintainable.
We looked at the efficiency and effectiveness of your unit and end-to-end tests, and at the line coverage they achieve.


Your code follows good coding practices. It looks generally clean and ordered. You can still make some minor improvements to it but the overall is good. You also have a good code coverage with 85% but unfortunately you do not have a second end to end test that checks the functionalities of the second milestone.

Regarding the APK, we are proud of the work you have been doing. The functionalities are there, especially for the discovery of people around. The use of the app is seamless, you have only minor UI fixes to do regarding the responsiveness of the interface that occludes some elements in the page, and to make sure that the texts are still readible in contrast to the background color of some tags. The offline mode works well and the sensor usage is good. We now advice you to improve the flow of messaging, making the UI more consistent accross screens and few more features on the discovery to make your app even greater!!


For this part, you received 12.6 points out of a maximum of 16.0.

## Scrum: Backlogs Maintenance

We looked at whether your Scrum board is up-to-date and well organized.
We evaluated your capability to organize Sprint 6 and whether you provided a clear overview of this planning on the Scrum board.
We assessed the quality of your user stories and epics: are they clearly defined, are they aligned with a user-centric view of the app, and do they suitably guide you in delivering the highest value possible.


Your backlogs are complete, especially for the coming sprint. We would advise you to try to split your user stories in smaller ones to be able to resolve them more quickly. Also, you should increase the planning of the product backlog to demonstrate your thinking of next features and the planning of the tasks. The product backlog can already contain tasks that you already thought about, this can help you plan ahead.


For this part, you received 3.8 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Documentation and Ceremonies

We assessed how you used the Scrum process to organize yourselves efficiently.
We looked at how well you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up during each Sprint.
We also evaluated your autonomy in using Scrum.


During each meeting, it is a great pleasure to see that you consistently filled the documents in advance, allowing the meeting to smoothly go on. The meetings are constructive and we are able to discuss your interrogations. You could maybe try to include more your teammates that are less talkative to make sure we have everyone's opinion. We would now like you to be more autonomous in the conduct of the meeting, letting you lead the review, retrospective and planning discussion, asking proactively questions when you feel it is necessary.


For this part, you received 3.7 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Continuous Delivery of Value

We evaluated the Increment you delivered at the end of each Sprint, assessing your teamâ€™s ability to continuously add value to the app.
This included an assessment of whether the way you organized the Sprints was conducive to an optimal balance between effort invested and delivery of value.


Your organization seems proficient. You are able to show us significant progresses each week, even if it means implementing a basis for a feature to make sure to finish on time. We believe that you will be even more proficient for this last milestone. Your challenge is now to make sure that the new features you add each week are well integrated for your user, as if you were releasing an update. This might not always be possible, but strive for this way of delivering, it will help you prioritize features and keep things clean.


For this part, you received 1.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0.

## Summary

Based on the above points, your intermediate grade for this milestone M2 is 5.20. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see the [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
